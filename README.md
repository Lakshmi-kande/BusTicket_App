This is the backend portion of the Bus Ticket Application.
The application is designed to handle ticket booking and management for bus transportation companies. It provides a set of APIs that allow users to create, read, update, and delete ticket data, as well as manage bus schedules and availability.
Users can signUp and logIn as either an admin or a regular user. Both types of users can signUp and logIn separately.
